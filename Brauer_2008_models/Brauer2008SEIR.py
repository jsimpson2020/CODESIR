#Uses Brauer model:

#S(t) is the number of individuals who are susceptible to the disease, that is,
# who are not (yet) infected at time t.
#I(t) is the number of infected individuals, assumed infectious and able to spread
# the disease by contact with susceptibles.
#R(t) is the number of individuals who have been infected and then removed from the
#possibility of being infected again or of spreading infection.
#E(t) is the number of individuals who have been exposed, but are not infectious yet

#Diff eq's:
    #S'=-betaSI
    #E'=betaSI-kappaE
    #I'=kappaE-alphaI
    #R'=alphaI
    
#Model assumptions:
    #(1) An average member of the population makes contact sufficient to transmit
    # infection with betaN others per unit time, where N represents total
    # population size (mass action incidence).
    #(2) Infectives leave the infective class at a rate alphaI per unit time.
    #(3) There is no entry into or departure from the population, except possibly
    # through death from the disease.
    #(4) Incorporate an exponentially distributed exposed period with mean exposed
    # period 1/kappa
    
# R0 is the basic reproduction number, which is betaS(0)/alpha
